# Office Add-in Server Authentication Sample for NodeJS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-NodeJS-ServerAuth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-NodeJS-ServerAuth)

A goal of many Office add-in is to improve user productivity, you can get closer to achieve this goal with the help of 3rd party services. Most of today services implement the OAuth 2.0 specification to allow other applications into the user data. Your add-in could be one of these applications.

However, you must keep in mind that Office add-ins run in a variety of platforms and devices. This presents a great opportunity for your add-in, but you must be aware of the following considerations when you try to make OAuth flows work across a combination of platforms and technologies.

## Considerations

Some versions of Office use an iframe to display the add-in. This poses an inconvenience for OAuth flows. The authentication flow in OAuth uses a sign-in page that can't be displayed in an iframe. The reason behind this is to minimize the risk that a malicious page takes control of the sign-in page. Your add-in should not try to display the OAuth sign-in page in the main add-in window.

**Solution:** Start the OAuth flow in a pop-up page.

Some browsers, most notably Internet Explorer, have the concept of security zones. If pages are in different security zones, you'll have a hard time trying to make them talk to each other. This might be the case of your pop-up and main add-in pages.

* The second consideration is pop-up and main add-in page communication. Some browsers, most notably Internet Explorer, have the concept of security zones. This means that they can't share cookies, JavaScript calls or other means of communication or shared data.

* Because of the communication challenges mentioned in the previous point, we can't be completely sure that the pop-up and the main add-in page share the same session. This poses a challenge when trying to  

* SInce the OAuth flow happens outside of your pages, it is hard for the main page to know when the OAuth flow is done. Notify the main add-in page that the OAuth flow has finished.

add-ins can be used in most versions of Office, including native applications and online versions across multiple platforms. This sample shows how to incorporate 3rd party services that are compliant with the OAUth 2.0 specification by using server-side technologies.

## Prerequisites

To use the Office Add-in Server Authentication sample, you need the following:

* [PHP](http://php.net/) is required to run the sample on a development server. The instructions in this sample use the PHP 5.4 built-in web server. However, the sample has also been tested on Internet Information Services and Apache Server.
	* Client URL (cURL) module. The web application uses cURL to issue requests to REST endpoints. 
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&DL=DEVELOPERPACK&ali=1#0) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > **Note:** <br />
     If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.<br /><br />
     If you are already signed-in to Office 365, the Sign-in button in the previous link shows the message *Sorry, we can't process your request*. In that case sign-out from Office 365 in that same page and sign-in again.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure Active Directory (AD) provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > **Important:** <br />
     You also need to make sure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this, see the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
* A [```client ID```](app/Constants.php#L29), and [```key```](app/Constants.php#L30) values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted the **Send mail as a user** permission for the **Microsoft Graph**. For details see [Register your web server app with the Azure Management Portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually#bk_RegisterServerApp) and [grant proper permissions to the Connect application](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-PHP-Microsoft-Graph-Connect/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Connect-application-in-Azure).

     > **Note:** <br />
     During the app registration process, make sure to specify **http://localhost:8000/callback.php** as the **Sign-on URL**.

## Configure and run the app

1. Map a web application in your web server to the **app** folder in your local repository. 
2. Using your favorite IDE, open **Constants.php** in the *app* folder.
3. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID* with the client ID of your registered Azure application.
4. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the client secret of your registered Azure application.
5. Start the built-in web server with the following command:
    ```
    php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t app
    ```
    
6. Navigate to ```http://localhost:8000``` in your web browser.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Unable to get local issuer certificate

You receive the following error after providing your credentials to the sign in page.
```
SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

cURL can't verify the validity of the Microsoft certificate when trying to issue a request call to get tokens. You must configure cURL to use a certificate when issuing https requests by following these steps:  

1. Download the cacert.pem file from [cURL website](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html). 
2. Open your php.ini file and add the following line

	```
	curl.cainfo = "path_to_cacert/cacert.pem"
	```
